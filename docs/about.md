# About

Deploy your RouterOS rules in a controlled environment. Stack provides you with a virtualized environment in Docker containers with Mikrotik RouterOS so that you can carry out your studies and tests. For this, we use the pre-configured images from the project [Mikrotik RouterOS in Docker :: EvilFreelancer](https://github.com/EvilFreelancer/docker-routeros) which already provides us with a base environment prepared for RouterOS.

The default template uses the image [Evilfreelancer/docker-routeros:latest](https://hub.docker.com/layers/docker-routeros/evilfreelancer/docker-routeros/latest/images/sha256-7ec9238c9b8fc9390d89f6ee3fb977d03d6ef437f09bc94f362e7fbcac7efffre) which already provides all the libraries needed to install a RouterOS instance.
